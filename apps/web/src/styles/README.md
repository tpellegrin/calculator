# Styles Folder

## Purpose

This folder owns the styling system, including themes, design tokens, global styles, and responsive design helpers.

## Rules

- **Theme Tokens**: All visual constants must be defined in the theme (e.g., `src/styles/themes/base.ts`).
- **Media Queries**: Use the `from` and `until` helpers in `src/styles/media.ts` for responsiveness.
- **Import Convention**: Components must use direct named imports for local styles from `./styles`. No namespace imports (`import * as _` or `import * as S`).
- **Naming Convention**: Internal styled components must start with `_` and include the owning component name (e.g., `_ButtonRoot`).
- **No Hardcoded Values**: Avoid using raw CSS values in components; always reference the theme.

## Avoid

- **Parallel Systems**: Do not introduce other styling systems (Tailwind, CSS Modules) unless explicitly authorized by Thiago.
- **Specific Component Styles**: Styles specific to a single component should live in that component's file or folder, not here.

## Extension guidance

To add a new color, spacing value, or font, update the base theme in `src/styles/themes/base.ts`.
